**Subject:** SEO & Digital Marketing Proposal for Warwick Quick Tyres

---

Hi [Client Name],

I hope this email finds you well!

I'm excited to share a comprehensive SEO (Search Engine Optimization) proposal for Warwick Quick Tyres. As you know, we've already built you a beautiful, professional website. Now, let's make sure potential customers can find it when they search for tyre fitting, MOT checks, or car mechanic services in Warwick.

## What We've Already Completed ✅

Your website has been fully optimized with:
- Complete technical SEO setup
- Structured data for Google
- Sitemap and search engine configuration
- Social media sharing optimization
- Mobile-responsive design

**Value delivered:** £1,200

## What I'm Proposing

I'm offering two service packages to help you grow your online presence:

### 1. SEO Foundation Package (One-Time: £1,000)
- Google Analytics setup
- Initial directory submissions (5 premium listings)
- Competitor analysis
- Custom SEO strategy document

### 2. SEO Growth Service (Monthly: £350/month)
- 5-10 quality backlinks per month
- Google Business Profile management
- Content optimization
- Review management
- Monthly performance reports
- Technical monitoring

**Minimum commitment:** 3 months

## Why This Matters

When someone searches "tyre fitting Warwick" or "car mechanic near me," you want to appear at the top of Google. SEO is how we make that happen. It's a long-term investment that:
- Increases your online visibility
- Drives more qualified traffic to your website
- Generates more phone calls and bookings
- Builds your online reputation
- Gives you a competitive edge

## Expected Results

- **Months 1-2:** Technical improvements, initial backlinks
- **Months 3-4:** Rankings begin improving
- **Months 4-6:** Significant improvements, measurable traffic growth
- **Month 6+:** Strong local presence, consistent lead generation

## Investment

- **Foundation Package:** £1,000 (one-time)
- **Monthly Service:** £350/month (or £300/month with 6-month commitment - save £300)

**ROI Example:** If SEO generates just 2-3 additional customers per month at £150 average service value, that's £300-450/month in additional revenue - covering the service cost and providing positive ROI.

## What's Included

I've attached a detailed proposal document that covers:
- Complete service breakdown
- Expected timeline and results
- Terms and conditions
- Payment options

## Next Steps

1. Review the attached proposal (`SEO_SERVICE_PROPOSAL.md`)
2. Let me know if you have any questions
3. We can schedule a quick call to discuss if you'd like
4. Once you're ready, we'll sign the service agreement and get started

## Questions?

I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. SEO is a long-term process, but the results are worth it - especially in a competitive local market like Warwick.

Looking forward to helping Warwick Quick Tyres grow its online presence!
